# Heart-Disease-Classification
Heart disease is a major health problem worldwide, especially for people older than 35. 
Atherosclerosis, which is when arteries get narrower due to plaque buildup, is a main cause of heart disease. This plaque is made up of things like cholesterol, calcium, and other substances. 
When it builds up, it can block blood flow to the heart muscle. This blockage can lead to a heart attack, a serious condition where the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.
Atherosclerosis happens slowly as plaque builds up on the artery walls. This buildup can slow down blood flow and reduce oxygen delivery to the heart muscle. 
This can cause chest pain (angina) and, in bad cases, a heart attack. The blockage can happen in different places in the heart, affecting different parts of it.


Project Goal:

In this project, we'll use a neural network to predict a person's health condition. We'll do this by analyzing different pieces of information about them. This is called a classification algorithm.


Data We'll Use:

We'll be using information about heart disease from a public dataset called the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  This dataset contains various details about different cases of heart disease.
